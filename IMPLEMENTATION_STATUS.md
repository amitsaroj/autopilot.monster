# Implementation Status

## Current State

**Fully Complete:**
- ✅ Auth Service (100%) - All models, services, controllers, routes
- ✅ Shared Infrastructure (100%) - All config and middleware
- ✅ API Gateway (100%) - Routing and Swagger aggregation

**Partially Complete (Need Full Implementation):**
- ⚠️ User Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Marketplace Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Cart Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Order Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Vendor Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Content Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic
- ⚠️ Admin Service (20%) - Has structure, needs models/logic

## What Each Service Needs

Each service needs approximately:
- 2-3 MongoDB models (~150 lines each)
- 1-2 Service classes (~300 lines each)
- 1-2 Controllers (~200 lines each)
- 1-2 Route files (~100 lines each)

**Total needed:** ~3,500 lines of code across 7 services

## Recommendation

Given the scope, I recommend:

1. **Test Current Setup First**
   - Verify infrastructure works (MongoDB, Kafka, Redis)
   - Test Auth Service (fully implemented)
   - Confirm API Gateway routing works

2. **Then Complete Services Gradually**
   - Start with high-priority services (User, Marketplace, Cart, Order)
   - Can be done iteratively as needed

3. **Alternative: Minimal Viable Product**
   - Each service currently has health endpoints
   - Can add endpoints incrementally as needed
   - Auth Service demonstrates the full pattern

## To Test What We Have

```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d mongodb redis kafka zookeeper

# Start services
./start-all-services.sh

# Test (services will start but have minimal endpoints)
./test-all-services.sh

# Test Auth Service (fully functional)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123456","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe"}'
```

## Current Capabilities

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ All services start successfully
- ✅ Health checks work
- ✅ Auth Service is fully functional (register, login, JWT, etc.)
- ✅ API Gateway routes to all services
- ✅ Swagger UI accessible
- ✅ Infrastructure connected (MongoDB, Redis, Kafka)

**What's Minimal:**
- ⚠️ Other services have basic structure but no business logic
- ⚠️ No product/cart/order operations yet
- ⚠️ No vendor/content/admin operations yet

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

**Option A:** Complete all 7 services fully (will require significant time/tokens)

**Option B:** Complete just User + Marketplace services as examples

**Option C:** Provide detailed templates you can fill in

**Option D:** Test what we have now and add features incrementally

Choose based on your immediate needs!
